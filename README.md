# Local_Roasting_Co_Website

  This repository contains the materials for a website I began building last summer, while working for Local Roasting Co here in Portland. This was my very first development project, which I used to begin teaching myself HTML and CSS. I have not finished the complete site, but I have many pages nearly finished. Screenshots of the more complete pages can be found on the main page, and the HTML and CSS files are located in the folder titled "Local Roasting Co Website". 
  
  
  My goals for this project were to familiarize myself with the structure and construction of basic HTML webpages, and to successfully implement them. Ongoing goals for this specific project include adapting the design for mobile platforms, and adding more interactivity using Javascript. I would also like to pull the whole project together using the Django framework so that I could create search forms, inputs for mailing list subscriptions, and a blog/news column that could be updated. 
  
  Unfortunately this particular project has been put on hold while I pursue more back-end and OOP language skills during my CS162 course this term.
